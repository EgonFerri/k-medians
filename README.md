# k-medians
In this report, we will discuss the general ideas surrounding the k-medians problem. We take a look at what k-medians attempts to solve and how it goes about doing so. Next, we will solve the k-medians problem with both an integer optimization approach (using AMPL) and a heuristic approach obtained with the minimum spanning tree procedure (Kruskal’s algorithm, implement in AMPL). Finally, we’ll close off our report with a comparison of the two solutions obtained, in terms of the objective function of the integer optimization problem and plot the results to procure a better visualization of the 2 procedures.
